# The Motivation for doing Science

> I find your lack of faith disturbing.

For better and for worse, I consider myself to be some kind of scientist. Not a lab scientist of course, but someone who tries to apply computer innovations to the biomedical field. There's nothing wrong with this. However, sometimes, finding the right motivation for doing science can be quite challenging.

A few months before finishing my phd I started sending my resume to a few companies in my area. I also send a couple ones to international companies and research groups but I admins I wasn't very keen in going to another country. I got some replies really fast and did some interviews. From there on, it was pretty clear that there were two types of companies offering something interesting. 

First, there were some really big companies (From big to huge) where having a phd meant exactly nothing. If you want a position there, you start by the bottom. A few months or a year in a trainee academy and then.  If you are really good, you might get a more stable (and better paid) position. These are the type of companies that are completely closed to outsiders, specially in a higher administration level. If you want in, you start at the bottom of the pyramid, whatever your degree.

Second, there are smaller companies, bigger than start ups but not yet large SMEs, that are willing to take the risk and hire you to a position in the middle of the pyramid. You won't start at the top, but your past research work is valued and your future contributions recognized.

I honestly thought it would be the other way around. Why do international companies add so many roadblocks to hiring more qualified personnel? This still worries me today...

As I mentioned in previous posts, I did not leave academia. And although I felt like leaving for a long time, I managed to turn it around, fill in the void, and find the right motivation to continue pursuing my research work.

I find my motivation in three simple areas: (1) research and apply state of the art technologies and ideas from one domain to an entirely distinct one, in my case, from computer science to biomedicine; (2) be part of bigger research efforts; (3) translate research work to the other business fields.

It may not be true about some more modern startups, but in the majority of classic businesses the freedom employees have to explore new things is very... limited. When you're doing research, specially in fields that require some kind of computer engineering involvement, you have the freedom to explore the latest technology trends and ideas. And I'm not just talking about programming languages, in most research groups I've seen, PhD students and general researchers can try distinct technologies, distinct protocols or algorithms. In fact, they encouraged to do it. And this "out-of-the-box" thinking ultimately results in greater innovation and, in the long run, better scientifc results. For me, the ability to use (and improve) "state-of-the-art" technologies is very enticing.

This is also directly related with the second point. For better or worse, national and international research projects  provide the fuel (i.e., money) that keeps the research engine running. Being able to participate in these kinds of large endeavors is immensely attractive. And not just on the broader soft skills side. These projects validate the work you are doing. If you keep producing good publications and delivering outstanding products, the probabilities of leading and being invited for new projects grow.

As for the last point, just look at [Google](http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/422/1/1999-66.pdf). They have managed to exploit their research algorithms and turn them into a successful business model.
