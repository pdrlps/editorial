# Abstract

**Objective**
To evaluate challenges and uncover opportunities in the exploration of patient-level data. With this, we hope to identify a scientific and technological roadmap for future developments in the field.

**Materials and Methods**
We performed a review of well-known initiatives, strategies and projects focusing on the exploration of patient-level data. These cover a broad array of topics related with patient data, from personalised medicine to patient registries up to rare diseases research, among others. These initiatives were identified through literature analysis and from EU- and NIH-funded project listings. For each, we identified basic goals, involved partners, defined strategies and key outcomes, establishing the foundation for our analysis framework.

**Results**
Following a screening of ## projects and initiatives, ## met our inclusion criteria and were assessed with greater detail. These were evaluated according to four key pillars: control, sustainability, technology and science, and further grouped in several non-exclusive categories.
From a scientific perspective,  ## in …
On a technological perspective, projects’ were divided by their key outcomes: ## with databases or datasets; ## with software tools, API or services;  and ## delivering only fundamental research.

**Discussion**
Substantial research outcomes have been produced towards the exploration of patient-level data. The potential behind these data will be essential to realise the personalised medicine premise in upcoming years. Hence, relevant stakeholders continually push forward new developments in this domain, bringing novel opportunities that are ripe for exploration.
 
**Conclusion**
Despite last decade’s translational research advances, personalised medicine is still far from being a reality. Patients’ data underlying potential goes beyond daily clinical practice. There are miscellaneous challenges and opportunities open for the exploration of these data by academia and business stakeholders. In this review we uncover multiple strategical guidelines, emphasising the best path towards the successful exploration of patient-level data.
