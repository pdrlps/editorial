# Discussion

- As this review reveals…

• Results are biased and strict
o   This is an ever expanding field with lots of people/projects/companies working
- This review is not without limitations…
- While we have tried to be comprehensive…
- This review is representative of past and present efforts in this domain.
- This review revealed some key limitations

## The growing relevance of genomics data

• NGS is streamlining the appearance of big data for patients
• Patient sequence is patient-level data
o   Will be included in clinical registries
• Whole new field of exploration for personalised medicine and patient-level data research


## Implications for future research

- There is a lot of room for improvement…
- The findings of our study reveal many areas of research that would add value to the existing implementations.
- Developing visualisation techniques that compliment these methods is an area of research also worth pursuing.
