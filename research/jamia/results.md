# Results

This review provides an overview of the different attempts at improving the exploration of patient-level data. These improvements stem from several areas of interest and cover miscellaneous research domains. This section details the projects’ evaluation according to our framework, including a tabular and visual comparison of their distinct features. From this evaluation we identify the main  challenges and opportunities for future research endeavors.

## Projects

After processing our initial set with over 100 projects ((ref Full Listings)), we analyised deeply the 17 projects that met our inclusion criteria.

## Challenges and Opportunities

With this evaluation we identified several challenges and opportunities. Challenges relate to data discovery, access, acquisition and ownership. This brings several opportunities to deploy future solutions that fully explore the enourmous amounts of patient-level data.

### Challenges

There’s a clear dichotomy regarding data. Patient-level data is a very specific use case for exploration. While there are too much data scattered throughout multiple stakeholders, they are wildly difficult to obtain. The outcome of this is that, in the end, there is not enough data to generate statiscally meaningful conclusions. Hence, we cannot discover or infer new knowledge because there is no access to a minimal amount of patient data.
Along with distribution, data heterogeneity arises as a key challenge for exploring patient-level data. There are several projects, namely … , … and …, dealing with creating new and improving existing data standards for data sharing. However, these are far from being widely adopted throughout international stakeholders. Bioinformatics and pharmacogenomics projects also face these challenges. Nevertheless, for these there are already adequate standards for data storage and exchange.
Data discovery, access and acquisition are typical problems that can be solved by improving existing technologies and by focusing on their widespread adoption.  Unlike these, data ownership is a much more complex issue. Dealing with data ownership involves tackling issues related with government’s policies, stakeholders’ interests and projects’ internal guidelines. In an ideal scenario, all patient-level data should be available for research purposes. This should be   particularly enforced in publicly-funded projects. Yet, this does not happen. As seen on Table x, most projects are not authorised to share data and, where data are shared, access restrictions are in place.

### Opportunities

Great challenges leverage great opportunities. With this review, we believe there is room for improving how we explore patient-level data and how we can use it to further improve research & development towards personalised medicine. 
There is huge potential behind the combination of data available worldwide. Yet, we need to develop and disseminate new technologies that improve how relevant entities collect, store and share patient-level data.
To obtain real advances in this domain, we must see worldwide patient-level data as a whole, and not as single dettached data silos. Although we already have the technology to accomplish this, stakeholders must unite efforts to make this holistic view a reality.
At the technical level, opportunities arise that demand the creation of new software and new standards. Likewise, at a policy level, we must improve existing guidelines and policies to better cover data sharing and ownership, and ethics issues.
New data management standards should promote better (and easier) ways to access and share data. This will promote knowledge discovery, and enable the integration and interoperability among patient-level data silos throughout the world. 
Ideally, new software tools will empower collaboration and sharing among patients and clinicians. These should promote ease of access to patient information and enhance the communication process among clinicians. Furthermore, new tools are required to enhance data ownership controls, facilitating how patients, clinicians or researchers express who has access to relevant personal data.
Despite the great opportunity for creating new standards and software, these assets alone are not enough to change the current scenario. New politics and guidelines, stemming directly from key worldwide stakeholders, must be disseminated to all interested parties. Moreover, with adequate support from governmental agencies (regional, national and international), projects and their internal partners will proactively work towards implementing these new guidelines.
