# Results

This review provides an overview of the different attempts at improving the exploration of patient-level data. These improvements stem from several areas of interest and cover miscellaneous research domains. This section details the projects’ evaluation according to our framework, including a tabular and visual comparison of their distinct features. From this evaluation we identify the main  challenges and opportunities for future research endeavors.

## Projects

After processing our initial set with over 100 projects ((ref Full Listings)), we analyised deeply the 17 projects that met our inclusion criteria.

## Challenges and Opportunities

With this evaluation we identified several challenges and opportunities. Challenges relate to data discovery, access, acquisition and ownership. This brings several opportunities to deploy future solutions

There’s a clear dichotomy regarding data. Patient-level data is a very specific use case for exploration. While there are too much data scattered through multiple stakeholders, it is wildly difficult to obtain. The outcome of this is that, in the end, there is not enough data to generate statiscally meaningful conclusions.
Along with distribution, data heterogeneity arises as a key challenge for exploring patient-level data. There are several projects, namely … , … and …, dealing with creating new and improving existing data standards for data sharing. However, these are far from being widely adopted throughout international stakeholders. Bioinformatics and pharmacogenomics projects already adequately use these standards for data storage in some scenarios. 

Challenges
• Humm… 
• Too much data, but difficult to access, so not enough data
• Restrictions on data acquisition
• Technology is way behind what’s needed
• Restriction on data ownership
Opportunities
• Huge potential behind the combination of data available worldwide
• See patient-level data as a whole and not as single detached data silos
• We have the technology to accomplish this
