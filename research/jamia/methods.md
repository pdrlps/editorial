# Methods

## Design

-•	Focus on literature and projects
•	Establish scenarios for analysis
•	We need to clearly define how we achieved our results
•	4 pillars framework
•	Control
o	Who owns the data
o	Who can access the data
o	Where are the data stored
o	Is the patient involved with defining the data ownership model
o	Security, privacy, auditing issues
•	Sustainability
o	Private or public data
o	Business model behind data owners
o	Will data be erased or stored in offline archives?
o	How long will the data stay online
•	Technology
o	Technological outcomes
o	Are there technical outcomes being produced
o	Services, APIs, Software, algorithms, databases
o	Text-mining and advanced knowledge integration/discovery or general flat-file storage
•	Science
o	Areas of research of project/initiative
o	Rare diseases, personalised medicine, genomics, proteomics, pharmacogenomics, biobanking, ehealth, infrastructures

## Evaluation Framework

•	Further specification of each of the four pillars
•	Include images/tables
Control

Technology
•	Multiple quadrants for analysis

•	NLP - normalisation + harmonisation (semantics + models) - knowledge integration - knowledge discovery
