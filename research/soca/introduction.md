# introduction


In this work we introduce an open-source framework to streamline data integration and web service interoperability tasks. Our goals are two-fold: enabling the automated real-time, reactive or event-driven analysis of data.

There is untapped potential in the real-time and event-driven integration of data. Researchers want to access the most up-to-date datasets; thus, ensuring that data are synchronized across resources continues to be an on-going challenge. Combining this need with the resources’ heterogeneity and distribution, and we have a major bottleneck for faster scientific progress.




- more data and more services
	- always growing
	- need for improved integration tools
	- need for improved interoperability tools
- developers and researchers demand FRESH data
	- access to real-time updated dataset
	- data as fresh as possible
- CHALLENGE statement
- limitation of current i & i approaches
	- time-limited snapshot
	- manual process
	- ad hoc solution
	- too complex or too simple
- our solution
	- introducing… i2x!
	- enable event-driven integration intelligently (and automatically) responding to events
		- trigger integration process
		- enable many-to-many interoperability
