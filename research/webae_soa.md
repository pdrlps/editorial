# WEBAE

Modern pharmacovigilance recommendations highlight the need for new strategies to monitor the safety of medicine usage in the general population and the adoption of web-based systems to enable direct reporting from patients to healthcare entities.
Web-based technologies exponential progress is only surpassed by mobile-based growth. Over the last few years, the mobile app concept has been redefined to a touch-based, user friendly interface, which puts access to all kinds of content and services at the usersâ€™ fingertips. Hence, the adequate exploration of this new paradigm is critical for the success of enterprise and research projects in the near future.
The health mobile applications landscape features mostly two types of applications: medical reference dictionaries, and direct healthcare access apps. 
Medical reference applications, such as Drugs.com, PocketPharmacist, WebMD or Epocrates, are already very popular in the mobile scenario. These applications target both regular users and clinicians, implying a price range from free to several thousand dollars. Key features include access to relevant information for diseases (clinical features, literature), all kind of drug information or symptom checkers. 
Drugs.com (http://www.drugs.com/) is an online drug information resource that features a complete drugs dictionary, a pill identifier updated daily, drug interactions checker and a possibility to record personal medication and receive FDA alerts. PocketPharmacist (http://www.danike.com/pocketpharmacist) has two main characteristics:  it provides complete information about a prescription and medication information, for both patients and health professionals. In addition to the comprehensive drug dictionary, it allows patients to keep a list of all medication being currently taken in a MedBox, recording time, dosages and allergies. While searching for a specific drug, the app also gives details about any adverse reaction. PocketPharmacist has recently integrated myDrugCosts (http://www.mydrugcosts.com/), providing instant  access to prescription drug costs.
Epocrates Inc. (http://www.epocrates.com/) is a company responsible for the development of several software tools including mobile applications, mostly related to healthcare, providing reference information about drugs and diseases, as well as, other diagnostic tools. Epocrates Rx is a drug reference app designed for US physicians. This app enables the querying of thousands of brand, generic and OTC drugs, including FDA-approved dosages, adverse reaction warnings and drug interactions, and plenty other information related to any available drug. Epocrates Rx also has a few extra features, such as allowing drug samples requests from participating pharmaceutical companies or offering clinicians useful, up-to-date medical news and scientific abstracts, selected by a Contributing Editor who is a leading researcher or expert in the field.
More recently, new applications are emerging that aim to provide a more direct connection between patients and health professionals. These applications include methods to schedule appointments in specific clinics, contact health professionals directly or get rewards for participating in drug trials. 
An example of this kind of applications is MangoHealth (http://www.mangohealth.com). Although it also includes a drugs glossary with all the information on adverse events, it intends to be more patient-targeted, helping them manage medication or supplements being taken, while establishing health goals. The app attributes points by taking medication on time. Another app that also implements this feature is Allayo (http://www.allayo.com/).
HealthTap (https://www.healthtap.com/) tries to shorten the patient-physician relationship, providing the users with a comprehensive clinicians directory, and allowing the patient to find the right professional, discuss symptoms and medication, schedule appointments and have access to a wide health information. An extremely important feature included is the multilingual option, the app is available in English, French, German, Italian, Northern Sami, Russian, Spanish.
In spite of the ever growing number of mobile applications, only a select few are awarded the FDA/EMA stamp of approval for clinical practice use.
MedWatcher (https://medwatcher.org/) is the FDA reporting system for adverse events. This system collects reports of adverse reactions and quality problems, not only with drugs and medical devices, but also with other FDA-regulated products (e.g., dietary supplements, cosmetics, medical foods, and infant formulas) and allows reporting online, by phone, mail or fax. This app expands the features in previously described apps, while encouraging users to spontaneously report any side effect related to drugs, medical devices and vaccines.  All the information is kept private and confidential and will be transmitted to the appropriate government agency and then, after being de-identified, will be shared with the community. In some cases, FDA will contact the responsible for submitting an adverse event for deeper information. The MedWatcher reports are recorded in an FDA database for review and comparison to similar ones. 
For pharmacovigilance reference and spontaneous event reporting on the web it is also important to refer to the YellowCard Scheme (https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/). Although it is not available as a mobile app, it allows UK patients to report a suspected adverse drug reaction or a side effect from a medicine or vaccine. It is run by the Regulating Medicines and Medical Devices (MHRA) and the Commission on Human Medicines (CHM), and is used to collect information from both health professionals and the general public.

Notwithstanding the depth and breadth of coverage of existing applications, there is room for improvement and we can clearly identify the added value that a new platform targeting the pharmacovigilance domain can bring. We expect this WEBAE proposal to improve the state-of-the-art in three key areas: 1) reporting of adverse events from mobile applications, 2) promotion of direct interactions with healthcare professionals, and 3) secure collection of aggregated data for easier integration with external systems from relevant stakeholders.

From tracking all kinds of events, reporting adverse reactions, interacting with renowned health professionals, to simple pill intake reminders, these features can be integrated in a unique mobile environment that will greatly advance the state of the art.



Room for improvement:

- mix of drug assistance tool (e.g. medwatcher) with spontaneous reporting system (yellowcard)
- open source / free app / cross-platform
- web-based, mobile and social media application (to promote the increase of AE reporting)
- the integration with event mining (this is under discussion)
- the API for EudraVigilance
- security profiles and access levels
- multilingual

- Spam/false reports filtering
- users profiling (to rank report confidence)
- drug repositioning (by using the same app to report also positive effects)
- promote patient-to-patient and patient-to-physician relations
- users rewarding features (difficult but a key point) - medical advising, "more like me" network, 
- patients engagement for clinical trials (pharm point of view)
- 
We will provide multiple easy to use interfaces where users can report adverse events, in detail and in a secure controlled environment. The reporting interface will be tailored to each user profile, including auto-completion and auto-suggestion methods based on the patient's history and on the summary data from similar patients.

By enabling direct real time interactions with health professionals (clinicians and pharmacists), WEBAE users will be endowed with a unique communication channel. This broad feature comprehends discussion forums, clinician chats, question & answer areas and the ability to setup appointments for phone calls or exams.
