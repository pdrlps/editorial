# Exploring Patient-level Data

## abstract

To evaluate challenges and uncover opportunities in the exploration of patient-level data. With this, we hope to identify a scientific and technological roadmap for future developments in the field. We performed a review of well-known initiatives, strategies and projects focusing on the exploration of patient-level data. These cover a broad array of topics related with patient data, from personalised medicine to patient registries up to rare diseases research, among others. These initiatives were identified through literature analysis and from EU- and NIH-funded project listings. For each, we identified basic goals, involved partners, defined strategies and key outcomes, establishing the foundation for our analysis framework. Following a screening of ## projects and initiatives, ## met our inclusion criteria and were assessed with greater detail. These were evaluated according to four key pillars: control, sustainability, technology and science, and further grouped in several non-exclusive categories. From a scientific perspective,  ## in … On a technological perspective, projects’ were divided by their key outcomes: ## with databases or datasets; ## with software tools, API or services;  and ## delivering only fundamental research. Substantial research outcomes have been produced towards the exploration of patient-level data. The potential behind these data will be essential to realise the personalised medicine premise in upcoming years. Hence, relevant stakeholders continually push forward new developments in this domain, bringing novel opportunities that are ripe for exploration. Despite last decade’s translational research advances, personalised medicine is still far from being a reality. Patients’ data underlying potential goes beyond daily clinical practice.  There are miscellaneous challenges and opportunities open for the exploration of these data by academia and business stakeholders. In this review we uncover multiple strategical guidelines, emphasising the best path towards the successful exploration of patient-level data.

## Introduction

The widespread collection of patient-level data represents a critical step towards the realization of personalised medicine. These data stem from primary care centres, hospital information systems, clinical trials’ cohorts and administrative platforms. Moreover, it withholds a huge potential that goes beyond daily clinical care.
Yet, along with the miscellaneous opportunities to explore patient-level data, this unparalleled growth of patients’ digital metadata brings several challenges. Data size, lack of open access, heterogeneity or the uses of primitive technologies are some of the issues researchers face when dealing with patient-level data. In contrast, exploring the potential behind these data will lead to the discovery of new knowledge, essential to improve the current clinical narrative.
Although patient-level data from public institutions, such as hospitals or regional/national administration centres, should be easier to access, it is generally locked under primitive technological implementations. This results in closed data silos that hinder scientific and technological evolution. Several large-scale projects already try to commoditize access to these data, whether through policies or technical standards for data exchanges.
Pharmaceutical companies are also responsible for a big chunk of patient-level data. Clinical trials’ cohorts generate comprehensive patient datasets whose value for personalised medicine research is immeasurable. Despite this, most of pharmaceutical data are private. 
It is important to distinguish between private companies’ data, which is the basis for internal research and development for new drugs and treatments, from public research datasets, fundamental to advance general scientific research. Although pharmaceutical companies are entitled to keep their results private, policies should be put in place to foster the sharing of clinically relevant results into the public domain.
Dealing with this heterogeneous mixture of private and public patient-level data, tools, standards and projects is in itself a complex research and development challenge. Ultimately, the entropy in this ecosystem is delaying what should be a swift evolution. Hence, we need to evaluate past and on-going initiatives to better assess and plan the personalised medicine research and development roadmap for the upcoming years. 
For this matter we established an analysis framework to evaluate the outcomes of existing initiatives, identifying current challenges and uncovering new opportunities. This framework is based on four key pillars: control, sustainability, technology and science. We assess several components in each of these areas, generating a rather comprehensive study:
•	the control section focuses on data ownership and access;
•	the sustainability topics cover the long-term perspectives for each asset;
•	on technology we assess the technical outcomes for each asset, where existing;
•	at the science level we identify the projects’ research areas and their key scientifc outcomes.
We present this comprehensive review targeting three key objectives. These were to (1) identify the best initiatives dealing with patient-level data, (2) inspect and study their different features and (3) evaluate tackled challenges and open opportunities.

## Methods

### Design
This review covers mostly past and on-going large-scale projects. Selected projects’ evaluation is based on an assessment framework with four key components: control, sustainability, technology and science. This design allows us to better understand the projects’ outcomes distribution as well as defining an initial categorization for each project. We chose topics for matching criteria in each area based on mappings with existing ontologies, e.g., SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) [1]() or EDAM (EMBRACE Data and Methods) ((ref EDAM)).
At the control level we assess several topics, detailed next.
•	Data ownership: Who owns the project data and who decides whether to make data available or not. Available options are project, partner or community.
•	Data access: Is there open access to the project’s data or is it closed to project partners. Available options are open, closed or partners only.
•	Data storage: Are data stored in partners’ private repositories or publicly shared with the involved community. Available options are private, public or partners only.
•	Patient involvement: Are patients in defining the data ownership, i.e., can patients control who can see their personal data in the project’s systems. Available options are yes or no.
•	Security, privacy and auditing: How are security, privacy and auditing issues dealt with within the project? Available options are external, project, none.
In this review we also assess the selected projects’ sustainability, covering several areas. These are detailed next. 
•	Business model: What is the business model behind the data owners. This has implications on what happens beyond each project’s scope. Available options are business, academia or undefined.
•	Data maintenance: Associated with the project’s partners business model, we have to assess what will happen with the collected data when the project finishes. Available options are composed of erased, stored, open sourced, offline or undefined.
At the technology level we evaluated several relevant areas for translational research. 
•	Technological outcomes: Are there (or will there be) any relevant technical outcomes from the project? Available options are yes, only scientific, too soon to know or unknown.
•	Technology: What are the main technological outcomes of each project. This includes web services, database, framework, library, virtual machine, infrastructure, standards or undefined.
At last, we inspected the key scientific outcomes for each project, evaluating their areas of impact.
•	Field of research: The fields of research to where the outcomes from the patient level data exploration will be applied. These include genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, epigenomics, phenomics, metabolomics, pharmacogenomics and other.
•	Area of Interest: Similarly to the field of research, we identified the technological areas of scientific interest that were studied in the project. Available options are analytics, annotation, data visualization, data integration, text mining, ontology, semantic analysis and other.

### Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

We searched for large-scale international projects in general financing listings and EU- or NIH-funded projects. The inclusion criteria for this review were as follows:
•	ongoing or finished after January 1st, 2010;
•	sponsored mainly by the NIH or the European Comission;
•	includes partners from both academia and the business sector;
•	must focus on rare diseases, pharma or direct patient involvment;
•	must have published public results.
For all identified projects, we reviewed titles, funding information, references and available publications to better assess if the projects appeared to meet all inclusion criteria. If insufficient information was available to make a confident decision, we contacted key project partners to disclose further details.

## 	Results
This review provides an overview of the different attempts at improving the exploration of patient-level data. These improvements stem from several areas of interest and cover miscellaneous research domains. This section details the projects’ evaluation according to our framework, including a tabular and visual comparison of their distinct features. From this evaluation we identify the main challenges and opportunities for future research endeavours.

### Projects

### Challenges and Opportunities

With this evaluation we identified several challenges and opportunities. Challenges relate to data discovery, access, acquisition and ownership. This brings several opportunities to deploy future solutions that fully explore the enormous amounts of patient-level data.

#### Challenges

There’s a clear dichotomy regarding data. Patient-level data is a very specific use case for exploration. While there are too much data scattered throughout multiple stakeholders, they are wildly difficult to obtain. The outcome of this is that, in the end, there is not enough data to generate statically meaningful conclusions. Hence, we cannot discover or infer new knowledge because there is no access to a minimal amount of patient data.
Along with distribution, data heterogeneity arises as a key challenge for exploring patient-level data. There are several projects, namely … , … and …, dealing with creating new and improving existing data standards for data sharing. However, these are far from being widely adopted throughout international stakeholders. Bioinformatics and pharmacogenomics projects also face these challenges. Nevertheless, for these there are already adequate standards for data storage and exchange ((refs)). 
In the same vein, data translation also arises as a complex challenge for researchers. In addition to the obvious sense, translating data between multiple languages, there is the data translation from a low-level free text data to structured information. Clinicians’ reports traditionally include their notes in free text. These notes must be mapped to a shared domain, elevated from simple text to meaningful structured knowledge.
Data discovery, access and acquisition are typical problems that can be solved by improving existing technologies and by focusing on their widespread adoption. Unlike these, data ownership is a much more complex issue. Dealing with data ownership involves tackling issues related with government’s policies, stakeholders’ interests and projects’ internal guidelines. In an ideal scenario, all patient-level data should be available for research purposes. This should be particularly enforced in publicly funded projects. Yet, this does not happen. As seen on Table x, most projects are not authorised to share data and, where data are shared, access restrictions are in place.

#### Opportunities

Great challenges leverage great opportunities. From our review, we believe there is room for improving how we explore patient-level data and how we can use it to further improve research & development towards personalised medicine. 
There is huge potential behind the combination of data available worldwide. Yet, we need to develop and disseminate new technologies that improve how relevant entities collect, store and share patient-level data.
To obtain real advances in this domain, we must see worldwide patient-level data as a whole, and not as single detached data silos. Although we already have the technology to accomplish this, stakeholders must unite efforts to make this holistic view a reality.
At the technical level, opportunities arise that demand the creation of new software and new standards. Likewise, at a policy level, we must improve existing guidelines and policies to better cover data sharing and ownership, and ethics issues.
New data management standards should promote better (and easier) ways to access and share data. This will promote knowledge discovery, and enable the integration and interoperability among patient-level data silos throughout the world. Going from patient-level data to summary-level data, and vice-versa, should be a simple straightforward process.
Ideally, new software tools will empower collaboration and sharing among patients and clinicians. These should promote ease of access to patient information and enhance the communication process among clinicians. Furthermore, new tools are required to enhance data ownership controls, facilitating how patients, clinicians or researchers express who has access to relevant personal data.
Despite the great opportunity for creating new standards and software, these assets alone are not enough to change the current scenario. New politics and guidelines, stemming directly from key worldwide stakeholders, must be disseminated to all interested parties. Moreover, with adequate support from governmental agencies (regional, national and international), projects and their internal partners will proactively work towards implementing these new guidelines.

## Discussion

As this review reveals, there is room for change in the exploration of patient-level data. However, we must take in account that these results are biased and strict. This is an ever-expanding field with lots of partners, projects and companies working in this subject.
While we tried to be comprehensive, this review has obvious limitations. Namely, identifying each project’s features and technical/scientific outcomes was a complex task. Once the projects finish, little to no effort is put into maintaining an accurate dissemination summary and rarely the projects results are assessed a couple years after each project’s conclusion.

### The Growing Relevance of Genomics Data

The core focus of this review revolves around projects dealing with patient-level data stemming from electronic patient records. However, the quantity and quality of patient databases focused on genomics data is growing. Furthermore, next generation sequencing technologies streamline the generation of huge patient datasets.
In a sense, patient sequencing data are patient-level data. Projects such as the 1000 genomes project ((refs 1000g), dutch genomics ((refs)), uk genomics ((refs)), are trying to sequence large numbers of individuals to better understand existing genotype-phenotype relationships and uncover new ones.
In the long-term, these data will be included in clinical patient registries. They may even be part of the electronic patient record, where clinicians will require new tools to explore these data. In summary, this is a whole new field of exploration for personalised medicine and patient-level data research that cannot be ignored.

### Implications for Future Research

As detailed in previous sections, the various opportunities highlight the room for improvement in this domain. Assessing the projects’ timing evolution we identify that the focus on sharing, dissemination and patient control is of growing relevance in the field.
The creation of new technical standards and data sharing policies will be fundamental for future research. Moreover, these topics are emerging in current project calls. Thus, they are becoming a stepping-stone for future research and infrastructure initiatives.
Despite the scale of on-going projects, they will not cover every possible topic. Technological developments in data visualisation, integration and interoperability, originating from distinct areas, must be brought to patient-level exploration. The foundation of translational research, where multiple technical research areas collide, will be even more meaningful in the future.

## Conclusions

This extensive review provides an overview of different initiatives that better explore patient-data. We limited our study to research and development projects in the recent past. We established base criteria to evaluate on-going initiatives. This resulted in the identification of several opportunities for future developments. Namely, (1) bringing distributed data together, (2) putting more advanced sharing and integration at clinicians’ fingertips and (3) pressuring stakeholders for stricter project evaluations will foster a quicker evolution pace. The lack of well-established and widely adopted solutions covering these areas represents a major roadblock for the adequate exploration of patient-level data. However, if future projects consistently adopt these overarching goals, personalised medicine will be one step closer.
