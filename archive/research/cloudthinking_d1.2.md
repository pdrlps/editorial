# Executive Summary



The Cloud Thinking project overall concept involves intertwined developments in four distinct areas, two geared towards research and two others focusing on applications. 
At the research level, work within this project covers Cloud Seeding and Cloud Gears fields. In these, we are exploring new software and algorithms to improve how the performance and management of cloud-computing ICT infrastructures, and to enhance the semantic translation of heterogeneous data to knowledge.
The application area is now starting to apply the latest Cloud Thinking’s research work to eHealth and Cloud Robotics. Within these sub-areas, there are miscellaneous challenges and opportunities that can only be tackled with state-of-the-art cloud-computing infrastructures.
Cloud Thinking’s goal is to bring the requirements and solutions together, to continually translate research work to the application domain. Despite eHealth and Cloud Robotics will fully realize the overall project concept, developed research will  be useful beyond these domains.
