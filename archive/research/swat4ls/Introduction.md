# Introduction

**Challenges**

- better exploration of document curation results
- tools & services for users and developers
- bridge the gap between document curation and knowledge discovery

**Proposal**

Use COEUS Semantic Web Application framework to deploy a document curation unifying layer, connecting the outcomes from automated and manual curation tools, such as Egas, with a unique knowledge discovery interface.

**Random**

Advanced tools such as Egas, â€¦ generate large quantities of biomedical associations, validated by human curators.

To fully exploit the potential behind these new associations, we need to employ a modern knowledge management paradigm, focused on the streamlined workflow from data acquisition (the curation step) to the knowledge delivery (accessing curation results).
