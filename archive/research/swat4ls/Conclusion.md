# Conclusion

- There’s a huge opportunity for exploring results from the latest text curation tools
- general assertions are obtained through advanced text-mining tools; specific assertions are curated manually, by real humans, who understand the text subject
- exploring the underlying potential behind these relationships will unravel undiscovered knowledge
- 
- making this curated annotations available to everyone, via the COEUS open framework, is a major leap forward to improve the text curation field, not only by providing discovery tools for existing curation applications but also to empower the creation of new systems

**highlights**
- document curation tools are traditionally closed, although their results can be extremely valuable
- despite the latest efforts, there are no systems that enable the comprehensive exploration of text curation results
- this “open door” for new knowledge must be exploited: enter COEUS, providing a streamlined automated workflow to connect text curation results with advanced integration and interoperability tools
	- from Egas to COEUS
	- assemble new knowledge in COEUS with assorted ontologies
	- from COEUS to the world (other apps + other users)
