What’s the best use case for this? Show an example of data curated in Egas being linked to a COEUS seed.

- Establish simple protein interactions as a valid use case for Egas+COEUS link
- Show Egas UI where user curates connection/association between proteins in a specific pubmed publication.
- Highlight the “pysical” transfer of that particular connection from Egas to COEUS knowledge base
- Highlight the discoverability of this new connection through the LinkedData interface and the SPARQL endpoint
- Highlight the open possibilities for connecting knowledge through federated SPARQL queries (with Diseasecard for instance)
