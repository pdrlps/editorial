# Abstract

Tackling the ever growing amount of specialized literature in the life sciences domain is a paramount challenge. Latest solutions use computerized solutions to automate the analysis, extraction and storage of relevant concepts and their respective relationships. Although these technologies produce accurate and precise results, the manual curation of documents is still essential to confirm discovered relationships.
The outcome of these complex document curation workflows provides valuable insights into the overwhelming amount of biomedical textual information being produced. Yet, the majority of automated and interactive annotation tools are not open, limiting access to knowledge and reducing the potential scope of manually curated concept relationships.
In this manuscript we propose an interoperable semantic layer to unify document curations results and enable their proper exploration, through multiple interfaces geared towards bioinformatics developers and general life sciences researchers. This enables a unique scenario where results from interactive annotation tools are harmonized and further integrated into rich semantic knowledge bases, providing a solid foundation for discovering knowledge.
