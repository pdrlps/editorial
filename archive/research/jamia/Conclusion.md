# Conclusion

This extensive review provides an overview of different initiatives that better explore patient-data. We limited our study to research and development projects in the recent past. We established base criteria to evaluate ongoing initiatives. This resulted in the identification of several opportunities for future developments. Namely, (1) bringing distributed data together, (2) putting more advanced sharing and integration at cliniciansâ€™ fingertips and (3) pressuring stakeholders for stricter project evaluations will foster a quicker evolution pace. The lack of well-established and widely adopted solutions covering these areas represents a major roadblock for the adequate exploration of patient-level data. However, if future projects consistently adopt these overarching goals, personalised medicine will be one step closer.
