# Discussion

As this review reveals, there is room for change in the exploration of patient-level data. However, we must take in account that these results are biased and strict. This is an ever expanding field with lots of partners, projects and companies working in this subject.
While we tried to be comprehensive, this review has obvious limitations. Namely, identifying each project’s features and technical/scientific outcomes. Hence, besides the overall project features we reveal key limitations associated their public evaluation.

## The growing relevance of genomics data

The core focus of this review are projects dealing with patient-level data stemming mainly from electronic patient records. However, the quantity and quality of patient databases focused on genomics data is growing. Furthermore, next generation sequencing technologies streamline the generation of huge patient datasets.
In a sense, patient sequencing data are patient-level data. Projects such as the 1000 genomes project ((refs 1000g), dutch genomics ((refs)), uk genomics ((refs)), are trying to sequence large numbers of invididuals to better understand existing genotype-phenotype relationships and uncover new ones.
In the long-term, these data will included in clinical patient registries. They may even be part of the electronic patient record, where clinicians will require new tools to explore these data. In summary, this is a whole new field of exploration for personalised medicine and patient-level data research that cannot be ignored.


## Implications for future research

As detailed in previous sections, the various opportunities highlight the room for improvement in this domain. Assessing the projects’ timing evolution we identify that the focus on sharing, dissemination and patient control is of growing relevance in the field.
The creation of new technical standards and data sharing policies will be fundamental for future research. Moreover, these topics are emerging in current project calls. Thus, they will becoming a stepping stone for future research and infrastructure initiatives.
Despite the scale of on-going projects, they will not cover every possible topic. Technological developments in data visualisation, integration and interoperability, originating from distinct areas, must be brought to patient-level exploration. The foundation of translational research, where multiple technical research areas collide, will be even more meaningful in the future.
