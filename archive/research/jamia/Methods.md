# Methods

## Design

This review covers mostly past and ongoing large-scale projects. Selected projects’ evaluation is based on an evaluation framework with four key components: control, sustainability, technology and science. This design allows us to better understand the projects’ outcomes distribution as well as defining an initial categorization for each project. We chose topics for matching criteria in each area based on mappings with existing ontologies, e.g., SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) ((ref SKOS)) or EDAM (EMBRACE Data and Methods) ((ref EDAM)).
At the control level we assess several topics, detailed next.
* **Data ownership**: Who owns the project data and who decides whether to make data available or not. Available options are *project*, *partner* or *community*.
* **Data access**: Is there open access to the project’s data or is it closed to project partners. Available options are *open*, *closed* or *partners only*.
* **Data storage**: Are data stored in partners’ private repositories or publicly shared with the involved community. Available options are *private*, *public* or *partners only*.
* **Patient involvment**: Are patients in defining the data ownership, i.e., can patients control who can see their personal data in the project’s systems. Available options are *yes* or *no*.
* **Security, privacy and auditing**: How are security, privacy and auditing issues dealt with within the project. Available options are *external*, *project*, *none*.

In this review we also assess the selected projects’ sustainability, covering several areas. These are detailed next.
* **Business model**: What is the business model behind the data owners. This has implications on what happens beyond each project’s scope. Available options are *buisness*, *academia* or *undefined*.
* **Data maintenance**: Associated with the project’s partners business model, we have to assess what will happen with the collected data when the project finishes. Available options are composed of *erased*, *stored*, *open sourced*, *offline* or *undefined*.
At the technology level we evaluated several relevant areas for translational research. 
* **Technological outcomes**: Are there (or will there be) any relevant technical outcomes from the project? Available options are *yes*, *only scientific*, *too soon to know* or *unknown*.
* **Technology**: What are the main technological outcomes of each project. This include *web services*, *database*, *framework*, *library*, *virtual machine*, *infrastructure*, *standards* or *undefined*.
At last, we inspected the key scientific outcomes for each project, evaluating their areas of impact.
* **Field of research**:  The fields of research to where the outcomes from the patient level data exploration will be applied. These include *genomics*, *transcriptomics*, *proteomics*, *epigenomics*, *phenomics*, *metabolomics*, *pharmacogenomics* and *other*.
* **Area of Interest**: Similarly to the field of research, we identified the technological areas of scientific interest that were studied in the project. Available options are *analytics*, *annotation*, *data visualization*, *data integration*, *text mining*, *ontology*, *semantic analysis* and *other*.

## Inclusion and exclusion criteria
We searched for large-scale international projects in general financing listings. The inclusion criteria for this review were as follows:
* ongoing or finished after January 1st, 2010;
* sponsored mainly by the NIH or the European Comission;
* includes partners from both academia and the business sector;
* must focus on rare diseases, pharma or direct patient involvment;
* must have published public results.
For all identified projects, we reviewed titles, funding information, references and available publications to better assess if the projects appeared to meet all inclusion criteria. If insufficient information was available to make a confident decision, we contacted key project partners to disclose further details.
