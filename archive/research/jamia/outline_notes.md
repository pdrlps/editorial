# Challenges and Opportunities for Exploring Patient-level Data

## Objectives

- review strategies and projects for patient-level data exploration?!?!
- what is the common ground?

## Outline

- Introduction
- Methods
	- Design
	- Inclusion and exclusion criteria
- Results
	- Tables
	- Charts
- Discussion
	- Implications for future research
- Conclusion

## Challenges

- translate data from free text to structured patient-level data
- security, privacy, access control
- where is the control? patient-centred or institution-centred?
- recruiting/acquiring patients and their data
- how to go from patient-level data to summary-level data? and, how to go from summary-level data to patient-level data?
- how to offer the same quality of access to patients in heterogeneous scenarios

## Opportunities

- can Semantic Web technologies homogenise patient-level data integration?
- big data trend

## Projects

### Axis

Idea: multiple charts/perspectives/statistics for multiple selections of project types

- timespan for each project (overlapping projects)
- research domains for each project 
- project outcomes


## Random Notes

- data-to-text is still important
	- challenge: how to translate data from free text to structured info
- multilingual patient registries
- semantic web
	 - can semantics really help?
- unannounced standardised patients
- genomic data are also patient
- security issues, encryption, who controls the data?
	- in patient-controlled scenarios, the patient chooses who, when and what data are accessed
- recruiting patients for clinical trials
	- these have the most patient-level data
		- pharma companies
		- patient registries
 	- more recently, online communities
- sick patients have more data
- most articles are focused on very specific environments, diseases, domains
	- hep
	- alzheimer’s diseases
	- diabetes
- there are drastic inequalities for patients in distinct countries/regions
	- EU, WHO, legislation
- online technologies
	- more patients go to web, mobile
	- one less hop on clinical trials
		- pharma no longer controls patient recruiting, online communities can accomplish that
- patient-level data integration is cumbersome and “rare”
- clinical trials data sharing must be in the interest of patients and/or science
- current pharma scenarios
	- private anonymised patient-level data are available upon request and review from independent panel
- GSK has the more “public” approach for patient-level data sharing
