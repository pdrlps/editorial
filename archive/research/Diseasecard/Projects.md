## RD-Connect

Diseasecard can be used throughout the RD-Connect project in many scenarios, promoting the collaboration of distinct institutions within the project and extending its value as a full-fledged solution to deliver easy-to-access rare diseases knowledge networks.

### RD-Connect Platform

Diseasecard is currently being used to show a rich network of gene-related information in the RD-Connect platform. The network is obtained through Diseasecardâ€™s API and includes a set of identifiers related to the given gene. The identifiers are then used to generate links to connected external resources.

**Example**:

Despite this integration, future versions should include a revised network. End users should decided what are the best data sources feature on the list. Likewise, Diseasecard is a rare disease oriented platform. As such, there are missing genes (only genes related to rare diseases are loaded).
