# Workplan

## Short Term

**Short term** developments should be ready as soon as possible.

### Case Studies

Think about new case studies and features that are essential to capture new users.

## Medium Term

**Medium term** developments are on a secondary range.

### API

* Add tracking.


### Knowledge Base

* Add support for more entry points (gene, protein, drugâ€¦).
* Add information about all genes.

### Search

* Improve search
	* Does it make sense to continue using Solr indexing?
	* Build smaller searchable index, just for the entities.

## Long Term

**Long term** developments are required but not critical for the releases. These  just cover features that are ready for implementation, not future ideas that can be included.

### Mobile version

There should be a mobile Diseasecard.
