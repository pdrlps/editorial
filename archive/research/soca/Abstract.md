**i2x: an automated real-time integration and interoperability platform**

In the age of cloud computing, the amount of data and services continues to grow. As data are easier to generate and services simpler to deploy, researchers continue to face unsurmountable integration and interoperability challenges. A major ongoing issue across multiple fields regards the automated and real-time integration of data and services. In addition to aggregating and processing disparate sources, we need an always up-to-date view of our datasets. Enabling realistic insights over acquired information requires that data should be as fresh as possible.
This perspective appears in opposition to traditional warehousing strategies, where data are manipulated regularly over large intervals.
Our proposal introduces a reactive and event-driven framework to simplify and automate real-time data integration and interoperability. This platform, entitled i2x, streamlines the creation of customizable integration tasks connecting heterogeneous data sources with a set of personalised services. 

i2x is an open-source framework available online at https://bioinformatics.ua.pt/i2x/.
