# Heroes/Villains

> You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain. *Harvey Dent, The Dark Knight*

I know that citation is not an actual literature reference, but it fits so many scenarios that it’s perfect to start this rant. Unfortunately, in so many areas of our lives - work, friends, relationships, family, hobbies, etc - it is way too easy to go from hero to villain.

Everyone has those friendships that peaked. There’s moments when it’s all great, going out, common vacation, shared dinners… Yet, it’s easy to reach a saturation point. When we start seeing the small personal features that we dislike. At this stage, it’s better to keep the distances. We don’t have to be together all the time, all the days. Or else, we’ll just be villains to each other’s eyes. 

This is also common in our jobs. When starting in a new place it’s usually easy to impress and to be impressed. If we put in enough hard work, sooner or later our boss will be happy. By keeping on a coherent effort we can quickly become a “hero”. Likewise, personal views on your team will be great.  Again, this will not last forever. The turnaround can be very fast or very slow, but eventually things will fall apart. 

Every story has an end. It’s better to finish on a high note than to progress (force?) the narrative so much that it starts to loose quality. Hence, we need to know when to leave. Staying in the same place forever is not a good thing. Lifetime jobs are a thing of the past, everlasting relationships are not everlasting and even family has its moments. And, although leaving can be hard, it’s best to leave when things are great than to stay too long and harm yourself, the team and the management.

More importantly, like in a gambling addiction, it is imperative to realize that we are on a winning streak and leave. 

Looking at our relationships, our job, our daily lifeâ€¦ we either are a hero or a villain.
