## COEUS
COEUS is a new semantic web framework, aiming at a streamlined application development cycle and following a "semantic web in a box" approach. The framework provides a single package including advanced data integration and triplification tools, base ontologies, a web-oriented engine and a flexible exploration API. Resources can be integrated from heterogeneous sources, including CSV and XML files or SQL and SPARQL query results, and mapped directly to one or more ontologies. Advanced interoperability features include REST services, a SPARQL endpoint and LinkedData publication. These enable the creation of multiple applications for web, desktop or mobile environments, and empower a new knowledge federation layer.
The platform, targeted at biomedical application developers, provides a complete skeleton ready for rapid application deployment, enhancing the creation of new semantic information systems.

### Key Features

- Semantic abstraction/translation
- Multiple integration connectors
- Base engine for i2x

## Bio2RDF
The Bio2RDF project uses a data integration approach based on semantic web rules to answer a broad question: What is known about the mouse and human genomes? Using its *rdfizing* services, a semantic mashup of 65 million triples was built from 30 public bioinformatics data providers: GO, NCBI, UniProt, KEGG, PDB and many others. The average link-rank (ALR) of a node is 4.7 which means that a usual topic is connected to 4.7 other topics by direct or reverse links within the warehouse.

### Key Features

- Covers lots of data types
- PHP-based rdfization
- Growing popularity

### Active XML-based Web data integration
 There is currently a strong trend for decision-making applications such as Data Warehousing (DW) and Business Intelligence (BI) to move onto the Web, especially in the cloud. Integrating data into DW/BI applications is a critical and time-consuming task. To make better decisions in DW/BI applications, next generation data integration poses new requirements to data integration systems, over those posed by traditional data integration. In this paper, we propose a generic, metadata-based, service-oriented, and event-driven approach for integrating Web data timely and autonomously. Beside handling data heterogeneity, distribution and interoperability, our approach satisfies near real-time requirements and realize active data integration. For this sake, we design and develop a framework that utilizes Web standards (e.g., XML and Web services) for tackling data heterogeneity, distribution and interoperability issues. Moreover, our framework utilizes Active XML (AXML) to warehouse passive data as well as services to integrate active and dynamic data on-the-fly. AXML embedded services and changes detection services ensure near real-time data integration. Furthermore, the idea of integrating Web data actively and autonomously revolves around mining events logged by the data integration environment. Therefore, we propose an incremental XML-based algorithm for mining association rules from logged events. Then, we define active rules dynamically upon mined data to automate and reactivate integration tasks. Finally, as a proof of concept, we implement a framework prototype as a Web application using open-source tools.

### Key Features

- Complete architecture
- Framework similar to i2x
- Only uses ActiveXML

### An event-based near real-time data integration architecture
Extract-transform-load (ETL) tools feed data from operational databases into data warehouses. Traditionally, these ETL tools use batch processing and operate offline at regular time intervals, for example on a nightly or weekly basis. Naturally, users prefer to have up-to-date data to make their decisions, therefore there is a demand for real-time ETL tools. In this paper we investigate an event-based near real-time ETL layer for transferring and transforming data from the operational database to the data warehouse. One of our main concerns in this paper is master data management in the ETL layer. We present the architecture of a novel, general purpose, event-driven, and near real-time ETL layer that uses a database queue (DBQ), works on a push technology principle and directly supports content enrichment. We also observe that the system architecture is consistent with the information architecture of a classical online transaction processing (OLTP) application, allowing us to distinguish between different kinds of data to increase the clarity of the design.

### Key Features

- Automated ETL
- Real time (without polling, just data being *push*ed)

### Event-Driven Data Integration for Personal Health Monitoring
The emergence of biomedical wireless sensors, the wide spread use of smartphones, and advanced data stream mining techniques have enabled a new generation of personal health monitoring systems. These health monitoring systems are mostly stand-alone and are not yet integrated with existing e-Health systems, which could seriously limit their large scale deployment. In this paper, we propose an architecture for data integration within an electronic health care network based on extending the traditional SOA approach with support for complex event processing and context awareness. This architecture also facilitates integrated business performance management against quality of care targets. A detailed health monitoring scenario for the care of cardiac patients is used to illustrate system requirements and to validate the proposed architecture. The expected benefits of our approach include a higher quality of care, reduced costs for health service providers and a higher quality of life for the patients. 

### Key Features

- Just a concept
- Applied to personal health monitoring/life sciences
