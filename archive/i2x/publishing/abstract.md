# Abstract


**Background**
In recent years data integration has become an everyday task for life sciences researchers. Aggregating and curating data from disparate sources, whether through advanced software or via manual processes, is a common task for scientists. However, the scope and usability of the majority of tools is limited.  

**Results**
With i2x, we introduce a cloud-based Integration-as-a-Service framework to simplify researchersâ€™ integration and interoperability tasks. i2x facilitates otherwise complex features, such as connecting heterogeneous services, transferring data from distinct endpoints or subscribing to dynamic data notifications. For developers, i2x automates the deployment of modern bioinformatics networks, using atomic data storage to enable an agent-based intelligent ETL proxy.

**Conclusions**
i2x bridges the gap between the growing number of services, accessing specific data sources or algorithms, and the growing number of users, performing simple integration tasks on a recurring basis. i2x accomplishes this through a streamlined integration workflow, available to researchers and developers alike.
