# Fear.

In parenthood, everything is fear. I live in constant fear. Maybe this is also true for life in general, but I’ve never been as fearful as I am now.

**Ignorance**

In a way, I envy my 8 months son. He's innocent and completely fearless. He can stand on top a ledge in the tallest skyscraper without thinking about any consequences. Living (growing) brings knowledge about everything that surrounds us. Knowledge brings fear. Knowing what can go wrong in any given scenario causes a small frightening sense that maybe, just maybe, in some occasion, our fears may come true.



Fear when I wake up that my son is sick again.

Fear when I go to bed that he’ll have another terrible night, constantly waking up throughout the night. I can’t relax in the living room, looking every other second to the audio feed from the bedroom. Is he awake? I don’t even lie down as I used to before. I just stay in the most practical way to get up as fast as possible when something is wrong in the middle of the night.

Fear I will not be able to pay all the bills in a few months.

Fear I will not find a decent and well-paid new job.


Fear my son will be unhappy.

Fear.

What does this cause? Ongoing stress.

The fear is growing. Fear that something is wrong with my son and that we just can't figure out what the hell it is.
