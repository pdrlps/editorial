# Fear.
I live in constant fear.

Fear when I wake up that my son is sick again.

Fear when I go to bed that he’ll have another terrible night, constantly waking up throughout the night. I can’t relax in the living room, looking every other second to the audio feed from the bedroom. Is he awake? I don’t even lie down as I used to before. I just stay in the most practical way to get up as fast as possible when something is wrong in the middle of the night.

Fear I will not be able to pay all the bills in a few months.

Fear I will not find a decent and well-paid new job.


Fear my son will be unhappy.

Fear my relationship with my wife is already destroyed and I’ve failed to save 
it.

Fear I will fail.

Fear.

What does this cause? Ongoing stress.
