# On Fatherhood
Or *6 months of awesome*

As of today, I've been a father for 6 months. Half year. And… it's awesome! 

I’ve been planning to write this text for so long. I really want it to be perfect (which probably reflects my overall atittude towards parenting). However, the perfect timing and the perfect text will never come, and I’ll never mangle all the ideas I have in any coherent form. So, forget about the copy and the structure, I’ll just dump everything as it comes along.

**The always upbeat soundtrack of your life**

This was particularly true in the first month. Especially until the first major problem with my son (7 days in the hospital). You know that feeling that everything is as it should be? “Everything in its right place”. You wake up with a gigantic smile on your face, even after sleeping for only a few hours. You see everyone under a new light, you face every challenge with renewed energy, yo

I admit this haze is clearer now. But it’s still there when I’m careful enough to look for it.

**Do it! No, seriously, do it.**

Despite having almost 9 months to prepare myself for the incoming changes, I couldn't foresee how much things would really change in a single day. Or better, in a matter of moments, from getting to the hospital to holding your newborn in your arms. The world changes in an instant.

To finish, my last piece of advice. Do think someday you’ll be more prepared, that you cannot financially cope with a child, that you still have plenty stuff to experience by yourself... Once you hold your newborn child in your arms, I'm pretty sure you will rise to the challenges ahead and just wonder why you haven't done it sooner.
