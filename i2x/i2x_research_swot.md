#### Strengths
- **Integration**: flexible support for multiple formats in & multiple formats out (although does not replace static strategies like COEUS)
- **Templates**: ability to write custom output delivery templates (open door for future plugin-based architecture)
- **Rules**: pre- and post-process integrated data with backward- and forward-chaining rules

#### Weaknesses
- Cumbersome **planning** & **development**: huge amount of features, dynamics, variables, controllers, services, methods...
- **Architecture**: too complex, too many components, too many points of failure.

#### Opportunities
- **Integration-as-a-Service**: lots of integration frameworks, not too many working on (near) real-time automated data integration
- **Bioinformatics**: automated and real-time are good  selling points to compete with more static  integration tools (Galaxy, Taverna, COEUS, Kettle, â€¦)

#### Threats
- **Competition**: despite the lack of academia competition, there are plenty business tools already focused on these strategies
- **Use cases**: not good enough to justify building a new framework at this scale
- **Usage**: another framework that nobody (internally & externally) will use
