# Conclusions

Nowadays, access to vast amounts of life sciences data is a vulgar commodity. Hence, modern integration strategies arisen to better explore available information. In spite of their quality, existing models lack built-in mechanisms for handling change and time. That is, connecting data and services is a manual task, whose only results are timeless snapshots.
With this research work we introduce a framework for next-generation integration and interoperability. i2x innovative features - automation, real-time, flexibility and adaptability - bring true added value to biomedical data integration.
Automation brings a new approach to the field, stimulating reactive and event-driven integration tasks. Furthermore, live data integration brought by automated and on-demand intelligent agents ensures data up-to-dateness. i2x is non-obtrusive, requires no changes in original data sources, and can process data to and from heterogeneous data sources, making it an extremely flexible and adaptable framework.
i2x is relevant for both researchers and developers, blurring the line between them. On the one hand, i2xâ€™s streamlined configuration process puts a powerful integration & interoperability framework at the hands of less tech-savvy users. This enables anyone to create business-level data and service integration tasks with reduced effort.
On the other hand, developers can download and use the framework open-source code. As i2x supports dynamic real-time message translation, formatting and delivery to multiple resources, it can play a central role in service-oriented architectures, from publish/subscribe to event-driven up to cloud-based integration-as-a-service environments.
i2x bridges the gap between data and services through a new intelligent integration and interoperability layer, further enabling the creation of next generation bioinformatics networks.
