# Pushing reset on life.




The deciding moment came with one final realisation. As a professor, I wouldn’t do any science, it would be my job to get the money. Write a grant here, beg for money there, write this paper for the next grant, read this journal article, review that journal article so that they’ll review my journal article, fly off to this conference, try and find some other way to bring in the money.
I would spend the next 5 to 10 years post-docing, hopping around the world, putting my life on hold, doing something I don’t even enjoy all for the chance of getting a faculty position, so I can kill myself to maybe get the chance, of getting a full-time tenured position as a professor, so that I can spend all of my time reading scientific literature and begging for money.
As soon as I finally admitted to myself that I did not want to be a professor, the rest became clear. Why the hell am I doing this to myself? Why continue to post-doc when I have no interest in where that road leads?
I’ve always loved teaching and demonstrating. I’ve always been very good at conferences, communicating science and networking. These things do not necessarily make me a professor, they make me a people person and these things would only a very small part of the job.
For over a decade and a half I’ve wanted to be a professor. It took a long time to admit it to myself and a hell of a lot soul-searching. The realisation is simple. My dream has not changed. I still want to be involved with people. I still would like to pretend that I’m making the world a better place. The reality is that in my head the word was wrong – I just need to find what word should replace professor.
I do not know what this all means. Over a week later I still do not know what this means.
The scary thing now is, now that I have decided what I do not want to do I am now faced with a whole world of possibilities. A daunting challenge, and one that frankly I have no idea where to start. So, I’m going to start at the end. Work out what I want, where I want to be in 5, 10 years from now and then I’ll work backwards and fill in the gaps.
In my decision to come here, I regret nothing. What I have learnt is that life is too short for negativity and mediocrity. I will never stop at anything less than happiness.
