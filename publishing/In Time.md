# In Time.

or *The sudden realisation that I'll be 30 this year. In about 7 months…*

A few weeks ago I was out having drinks with my wife and we end up talking about time. This may seem a rather trivial feeling, but we were discussing how the way we perceive time changes over time (!).
The conversation started because, doesn't matter where we are, we end up talking about our son. In this particular night we were talking about on the cliche of time going by really quickly. 
About 1 year ago we were having our first labour preparation classes. 10 years ago, I was in my second year at the university and probably in the lowest point in my adult life. 20 years ago… well, I don’t even remember, but if my calculations are correct I was in 4th grade, and my teens were just around the corner.
Now, the 30s are around the corner. Although I’ve never had the feeling that time goes by unnoticed, I’m suddenly realising that my perception of time is constantly changing. The last year went by in the blink of an eye. Memories from my first university years are getting all blurred. How did I spend my time when I was 10? I have no idea.
XKCD has a great drawing on this. In May, we will be farther away from the release of Star Wars Episode I, than this release was from the release of Episode VI. How can this be? My perspective is that living our digital lives further accelerates how we perceive time. 
Everything happens so fast these days. If there’s an earthquake in Japan, the news will be all over Twitter before the shock wave hits US’ west coast. We can travel by air between continents and be online most of the time. 50 years ago, when people moved to another country or fought in a war overseas, they had to write a letter telling everything was fine. When the letter reached the destination, the sender could already be dead. The sparkle we see in the stars has been emitted years ago. Today, moving to another country is almost trivial. I can Skype home whenever I want.
Never has the “carpe diem” cliche meaning been so clear in my mind. We really must enjoy our days much more and go to bed with the good feeling of having a good day.

The relative speed at everything happens forces us to be on constant change. Although I'm always striving for stability, the last couple of years brought great change to my life. And it is not over. Trying to find the time to create our own personal routines should be easier. However, the burden of our work-life balance complicates these tasks. Can we be really become our best to others if we don't even have the time for being the best to ourselves?
