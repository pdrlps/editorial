# CoimbraGenomics



## Polishing

* refine application
	* including UI and server-side components
	* make it fast, lean and clean
* **delight is in the details**: improve all the small interactions to make ELSIE a joy to use
	* the difference between products and **great** products

## Scalability/Performance/Engineering

* how will the platform handle hundreds of simultaneous requests?
* now it runs on EC2 instance?
	* improving the instance (more disk, more memory) is not solving the problem
* Java apps are complex for handling scale
* is there a cache?
* how to make it faster?
	* how to make it faster for everyone, with ks of users

## Auditing/Statistics

* Essential sales pitch for the holistic perspective
	* we need to know how many doctors ask for each disease
* analyse trends
* analyse evolution
* know the system status in real-time
	* how many pending requests?
	* where is the bottleneck?
	* how to optimize a given procedure?
* selling point to include pharma companies in the platform?


## Data 2 Knowledge

* we are collecting lots and lots of data
* patients authorise using their genome sequence for research, by default
* mine all the data
* find correlations
	* science!

## Automation

* optimize back-office processes
	* notifications
	* emails
	* sms
	* delays
	* system status
	* **events**

## Going mobile
 
* eventually, clinicians will want to be notified on their iPhones when the results are ready
* mobile-first approach
* apps for the platform
* apps for authentication TBOTP
